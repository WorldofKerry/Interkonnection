Given a table of data with headers on the top, each row is an example/sample, and each column is a feature
## Types
Categorical features, numerical features
## Cleaning
To remove noise, outliers, missing values, duplicate data
## Features
### Aggregation
combine features (e.g. combine city data points into provinces), which reduces [[Time Complexity]]/[[Space Complexity]] but results in loss of data
### Transformation
#### Discretization (Binning)
Turn numerical data into categorical (e.g. age groups)
### Selection
Remove features not relevant to task
