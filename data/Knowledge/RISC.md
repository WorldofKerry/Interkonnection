An instruction set design philosophy that is specifically targeted at high performance. Main principle: add complexity only to make common cases faster. 

Hardware made to run a simplified RISC instruction set is often used to teach [[Field-programmable Gate-Arrays (FPGA)]]s. 

The [[Nios II]] and [[Microblaze]]  are examples of 32-bit RISC processors.
