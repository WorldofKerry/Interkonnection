- [[Entity-Relationship (ER) Model]]
## Conceptual Modeling
A diagram graph with the following types of nodes: 
- Rectangles are entities
- Ovals are attributes, and if they are underlined, they are also keys
- Diamonds are relationships
## Relational Model
Separates the logical and physical views of the data
## Make Design Efficient
How to minimize space without losing information? Related to "Normal Forms"
## Deciding on Query Languages
e.g. SQL, RA and Datalog
## Data Warehousing and OLAP
Organizations analyzing current and historical data to identify useful patterns
## Data Mining
Analysis large quantities of data in order to discover valid, novel, actionable patterns in data
## Create an Application
Use a programming language (Java and JDBC) to interface with database
## Schemas and Instances
First create a scheme, the logical structure of the database; later populate instances, the actual content of the database at a particular point in time. By extension, there is physical data independence (ability to modify physical scheme without changing logical), and logical data independence (change conceptual scheme without changing applications).
