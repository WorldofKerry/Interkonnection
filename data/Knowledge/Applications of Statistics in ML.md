## Data
Given a table of data with headers on the top, each row is an example/sample, and each column is a feature. More info at [[Data]]. 
### Types
Categorical features, numerical features
### Cleaning
To remove noise, outliers, missing values, duplicate data
### Features
#### Aggregation
combine features (e.g. combine city data points into provinces), which reduces [[Time Complexity]]/[[Space Complexity]] but results in loss of data
#### Transformation
##### Discretization (Binning)
Turn numerical data into categorical (e.g. age groups)
#### Selection
Remove features not relevant to task

## Entropy
entropy $= -\sum_{c=1}^kp_c\log p_c$, where $p_c$ is the proportion of times you have value 'c'
