Convert all features to a standard unit, otherwise large features will contribute more than small features. 
## Method for Train Data
1. For each feature, compute mean and standard deviation. 
2. Subtract mean and divide by standard deviation. 
## Method for Test Data
Use mean and standard deviation of training data.
