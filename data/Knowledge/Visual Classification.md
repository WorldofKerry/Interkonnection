Includes object classification (label per image), detection (label per region), segmentation (label per pixel). There's also structured image understanding (using words to describe image), and shape modelling and tracking. 
## Image Classification
Instance (your dog) vs category (dogs). 
Local feature recognition (e.g. SIFT+RANSAC) fails with large apperance variation, which exists in most object categories. E.g. a Pug has few features matching a German Shepherd. A way to overcome this is to use [[Visual Words]]. 
### [[Bag-of-Words]]
A image classification technique.
