# Image Pyramid

## Gaussian Pyramid

Blur with a Gaussian kernel, then select every second pixel. Generated by successive Gaussian blurring and down sampling.

Cannot reconstruct the original image using the image at the upper level.

Used for image resizing and sampling.

## Laplacian Pyramid

Retains the residuals instead of the blurred images themselves. Retains the band-pass. Generated by differences between successive levels of a Gaussian Pyramid.

The original image can be reconstructed using the top level gaussian pyramid image, and the entire Laplacian pyramid.

There needs to be down-sample followed by up-sample to guarantee perfect reconstruction, which is generally not possible.

Use for pyramid blending, feature extraction, etc.

# Image Blending

## Pyramid Blending

Smooth low frequencies, preserve high frequency detail

Steps:

1.  Specify an image mask
2.  Blend lower frequency bands over larger spatial ranges, high frequency bands over small spatial ranges
