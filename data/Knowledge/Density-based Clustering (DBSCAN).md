Clusters are defined by dense regions and can be non-[[Convex Set]]. This is a [[Non-Parametric Models]] clustering method. 
## Parameters
- Epsilon $\epsilon$: distance we use to decide if another point is a neighbour
- MinNeighbours: number of neighbours needed to say a region is dense
	- A point is called a "core" point if you have at least MinNeighbours neighbours.
