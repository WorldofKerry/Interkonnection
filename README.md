# Interkonnection
Interkonnection is an educational tool that aims to help learners make connections between different topics and subject areas. The idea is to create a visual representation of a person's knowledge, similar to a graph, that shows the connections between different topics. This can help learners see the relationships between different subjects and understand how they are connected, which can make learning more enjoyable and effective.

One potential application of Interkonnection is in the field of liberal arts, where it can help learners see the connections between different disciplines such as literature, history, and philosophy. It could also be useful in the sciences, where it can help learners understand the connections between different branches of science such as biology, chemistry, and physics.

In addition to helping learners understand the connections between different subjects, Interkonnection could also be useful for educators who want to design lesson plans that incorporate interdisciplinary learning. By using Interkonnection to visualize the connections between different subjects, educators can create lesson plans that are more engaging and effective.

Overall, Interkonnection is a useful tool for learners and educators who want to make learning more enjoyable and effective by helping learners see the connections between different subjects.

I'm especially looking for more connections relating to social/biological/chemical sciences, liberal/creative arts, buisness, psychology, communcation, etc.

## Bugs
- Nodes with brackets () in their name seems to have no backlinks
- ![[image]]![[image]] not being filtered out with regex, currently fixed with code commented with BUG1

## Todo
- Add a search bar to every node page, to be able to search for the shortest path from one node to another node (Dijkstra's)
- Autofill empty pages with Wikipedia/ChatGPT
- Parse the latex
